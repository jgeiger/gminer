        <h4>gminer works best with a newer browser than you are using.</h4>
        <p>To get the best possible experience using gminer, we recommend that you upgrade your browser to a newer version. The current version is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx" target="_blank">Internet Explorer 7</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx target="_blank"">Internet Explorer 8</a>. The upgrade is free. If youâ€™re using a PC at work you should contact your IT-administrator. Either way, we'd like to encourage you to stop using IE6 and try a more secure and Web Standards-friendly browser.</p>
